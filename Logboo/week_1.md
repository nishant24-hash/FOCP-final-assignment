# Introduction to Programming- week1 
## Fundamentals of Computer Programming

---

## What this module is about
This module teaches the **basic ideas of computer programming**.

We use **Python** as the programming language, but the ideas you learn here can be used in **any programming language**.

Python is used because:
- It is easy to read and understand
- It is beginner-friendly
- It is widely used in real-world applications

The module includes:
- Lecture notes
- Tutorials
- Practice exercises  

Most of the work is done using the **Python interpreter**.

## What is a computer program?
A computer program is a **set of instructions** that tells a computer what to do.

Every program usually:
- Takes some **input**
- Processes that input
- Produces **output**

Input and output do not always come from a keyboard or screen.  
They can also come from files, sensors, or other programs.

Programs are written using **programming languages**, which are easier for humans to understand.  
The computer then translates these instructions into a form it can run.

## Generations of programming languages
Programming languages have changed over time to make programming easier.

### First Generation (1GL)
- Written in **machine code** (only numbers)
- Very difficult to read and write
- Different for each type of computer
- Hard to fix errors

### Second Generation (2GL)
- Called **assembly language**
- Uses short words instead of numbers
- Converted to machine code using an **assembler**
- Still difficult and not portable

### Third Generation (3GL)
- Most commonly used today
- Examples:
  - C, Java, C++, C#
  - Python, JavaScript, PHP
- Easier to read and write
- Use **compilers** or **interpreters**

### Fourth Generation (4GL)
- Focus on **what to do**, not **how to do it**
- Designed for specific tasks
- Examples:
  - SQL (databases)
  - R (statistics)
- Not used for general programming

## Why Python?
Python is a **third-generation language** that is:
- Easy to learn
- Powerful
- Used in many areas like AI, data science, and web development

Python supports:
- Procedural programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming

This makes Python a great first language to learn.

## How we will use Python

### Python Interpreter
- Works in the command line
- Uses **REPL**:
  - Read
  - Evaluate
  - Print
  - Loop
- Gives instant results
- Good for learning and testing small code

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Used for bigger programs
- Provide:
  - Code editor
  - Debugging tools
  - File management
- More powerful but slightly harder to learn

---

## Software and tools
- All software used is **free**
- Python **3.7 or newer** is required
- Python 2 is outdated and not used
- Any text editor can be used to write code

---

## Python libraries
Python uses **libraries** to avoid rewriting code.

Libraries:
- Contain ready-made functions
- Save time
- Make difficult tasks easier

In this module, we first learn **basic Python**, then use libraries later.

---

## Expressions in Python
An expression is a **simple calculation**.

Examples:
```python
45 + 20
10 * 3
100 / 4
